# ZAP Scan Rules Configuration
# Format: scanID	threshold	action

# Thresholds: FAIL, WARN, IGNORE
# This file configures which security issues should fail the build vs just warn
#
# We allow warnings for issues that only affect 404 pages (acceptable for API-only backend)
# but fail on critical security vulnerabilities

10049	WARN	# Non-Storable Content (acceptable - API responses shouldn't be cached)
10055	WARN	# CSP: Failure to Define Directive (acceptable on 404 pages only)
10098	IGNORE	# Cross-Domain Misconfiguration (false positive for CORS-enabled APIs)
